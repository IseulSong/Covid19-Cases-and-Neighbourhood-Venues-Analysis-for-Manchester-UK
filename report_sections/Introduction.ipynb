    "This project aims to provide understanding of relationship between the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and neighbourhoods in Manchester. In particular, it will focus on how the infection rates differ by neighbourhoods and their composition of venue types to understand if neighbourhoods which have the majority of a certain type of venues are likely to have higher number of cases. This report will target policy makers and healthcare-sector workers who may be interested in effectiveness of measures to stop the spread of the virus by restraining residents from particular activities."
