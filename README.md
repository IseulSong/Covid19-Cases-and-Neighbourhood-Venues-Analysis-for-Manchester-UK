Covid-19 is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus. Since the outbreak of the virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, more than 23.6 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, leading to more than 814,000 death as from 25 August 2020.
Manchester is one of the hotspots of the Covid-19 cases compared to the rest of the UK. The UK government has recently tightened social distancing measures in the area to stop the spread of the virus.
In this context, this project undertook a case study of Manchester to provide an understanding of the potential relationship between Covid-19 infection rates and neighbourhoods in Manchester. In particular, it focused on how the infection rates differed by the neighbourhoodsâ€™ most common venue types to investigate if a neighbourhood which had certain types of venues the most was likely to have higher infection rates. This study targeted policymakers and healthcare-sector workers who might be interested in the effectiveness of measures to stop the spread of the virus by restraining people from particular activities.
